Inductive programming is a field whose main goal is synthesising programs that respect a set of examples, given some form of background knowledge. There are two main areas of research: inductive logic programming (ILP) and inductive functional programming (IFP). In this project, we construct an IFP system, but we draw ideas from the ILP system Metagol  \cite{metagol}. We try to give the problem a formal setting, making analogies to ILP. We also inspect whether the synthesized functions could be reused, something that has not really been researched before. We compare out system to other systems.
